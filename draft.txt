I wrote new blog that contributed to Azure Database for MySQL Tech Community. The blog includes the details of CDC which our customers often use but our support engineers may not be familiar with. I wrote the blog that would be help to understand what is CDC and build a test environment to reproduce customers' issue. If customers need guidance to build CDC, our support engineers could refer to this blog and share with customer. 
In the community website, there are a few blogs that were published a few years ago. Some of the queries and scripts were already deprcated. I contacted the contributors to update the blogs to make sure the information is up to date. The contributors mentioned my suggestions are helpful and they would update their blogs. This can also save time for readers to build their environment and reduce the questions that customers have.  

I contributed to Support-Delivery Excellence, drove positive, solid, incremental improved customer experience. Customer also gave positive feedback to my support-delivery.

I have actively participated in Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) courses and engaged in D&I conversations with our team members. In our discussions, we realized sometimes we made a decision based on the first instinct or on a past positive or negative experience. These decisions could be guided by our unconscious bias. We also share our experience on bias, and negative impact it brought.

The cources and conversations helped us understand bias and its impact to team effectiveness. Practicing awareness by acknowleging our unconscious bias and how it affects us can help us question our mindset and behaviors when making decisions. The courses helped us grow up our awareness to counteract unconscious bias, mitigate the work-related disturbances caused by it.



Our team members are from all over the world. Since we have different universe backgrounds, I did .... to make my thoughts and intentions are clear and obvious to others.

When I first started doing postgresql cases, I would encounter some complicated situations. Even after checking our TSG and other troubleshooting guidance, there was no good solution. Despite my best efforts, I was unable to solve the problem in timely manner, which led to a delay in the delivery.

I then approached my senior colleagues and mentor, seeking their feedback on my approach to the problem. But seeking help is not always an efficient approach to resolve the issue, my colleagues have their own work to do and may not able to response in time. Therefore, I learnt I need to build up my own skills. 

What I did: 
To gain more experience, I reviewed my colleagues' cases and learn how to deal with such problems from their handling, especially topics that I am not familiar with.
To handle the cases faster, I practice multi-task skills in daily work. When I got many works to do, I would organize my tasks and handle them effectively.

After having more experience, I can now deal with problems much faster than before. I learned that when you first start doing something, you will encounter some difficulties. If you encounter difficulties, you must have a growth mindset to overcome them.

When I initially began working on PostgreSQL cases, I often found myself dealing with complex situations. Despite thoroughly consulting our Technical Support Guide and other troubleshooting resources, I struggled to find effective solutions. Despite my best efforts, I was unable to resolve the issues promptly, resulting in delays.

Subsequently, I reached out to my senior colleagues and mentors, seeking their feedback on my problem-solving approach. However, I realized that consistently seeking help wasn't the most efficient strategy, as my colleagues also had their own workload and might not always be able to respond in a timely manner. This realization underscored the importance of enhancing my own skills.

Here's what I did:
To gain more practical experience, I reviewed cases handled by my colleagues, learning how to manage similar problems from their approach, especially those within unfamiliar topics.
To expedite case resolution, I honed my multitasking skills. Whenever I was faced with multiple tasks, I made a conscious effort to organize my tasks and tackle them effectively. This practice not only improved my productivity but also my problem-solving efficiency.

After having more experience, I am now able to address problems much faster than before. I learnt adopting a growth mindset is essential to navigate these hurdles and continuously improve.

I completed the "Speaking Up in Moments that Matter" training and applied these learnings to support my colleagues, fostering an inclusive environment.

Firstly, I participated in team discussions related to D&I, encouraging constructive conversations around diversity and inclusion in our working relationships. This helped to foster an environment where everyone felt valued and included.

Additionally, I demonstrated empathy and practiced allyship skills by connecting with other employees. This included mentoring a new member from the partner team, helping them get ready on PostgreSQL topics and troubleshooting skills.

I completed and applied learnings from required Security Foundations and Trust Code (Standards of Business Conduct) trainings, which helped me stay updated on the latest security practices and guidelines. 

I articulated the Secure Future Initiative (SFI) to customers and partners, helping them understand Microsoft's commitment to security and how it benefits their business.

I stayed informed about the current security landscape by utilizing resources like the Incident Resource Hub. This enabled me to stay updated on new and emerging threats and understand how Microsoft is responding to them.

Azure MySQL single server was retired, but the migration to flexible is not completed for many customers. They need to migrate to flexible and raise crisit/urgent tickets to us. However, Product team does not allow to raise severity 2 ICM to activate the oncall engineer for single to flexible issues. When I received such crisit ticket on Sunday, I needed assistance to fix server issue from the Product Group but couldn't find the resource available. Instead of being discouraged, I took the initiative to find solutions on my own or used soft skills to explain to customers about our limited resources during weekends and the single server retirement policy and explain that issue would request more time.  

Another setback was not fully understanding some content in the TSGs, which required me to engage with the EEE team for help. I took this as an opportunity to learn and improve my knowledge. By seeking assistance from the EEE team, I was able to enhance my understanding of the topics and provide better support to customers in the future.

From this experience, I realized the importance of soft skills. I plan to attend more training sessions and workshops to gain further insights into soft skills. For instance, there are courses available that introduce support engineers to Microsoft's definition of soft skills, discussing what is expected regarding improving customer interactions and utilizing soft skills to resolve escalated situations. Engage in training that emphasizes working with upset customers, delivering bad news, uncovering customer needs, and phone-based customer service. These sessions can help develop empathy and active listening skills, which are crucial for effective communication.
