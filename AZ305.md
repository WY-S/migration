## Topic 3 - 27

1、DB

 You have 100 servers that run Windows Server 2012 R2 and host Microsoft SQL Server 2014 instances. The instances host databases that have the fo lowing characteristics:  Stored procedures are implemented by using CLR.  The largest database is currently 3 TB. None of the databases wi l ever exceed 4 TB.  You plan to move a l the data from SQL Server to Azure.  You need to recommend a service to host the databases. The solution must meet the fo lowing requirements:  Whenever possible, minimize management overhead for the migrated databases.  Ensure that users can authenticate by using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) credentials.  Minimize the number of database changes required to facilitate the migration.

2、ADF

You have an Azure subscription that contains an Azure Blob Storage account named store1.  You have an on-premises file server named Server1 that runs Windows Server 2016. Server1 stores 500 GB of company files.  You need to store a copy of the company files from Server1 in store1.

3、Service Bus

You have an Azure subscription that contains two applications named App1 and App2. App1 is a sales processing application. When a transaction in App1 requires shipping, a message is added to an Azure Storage account queue, and then App2 listens to the queue for relevant transactions.  In the future, additional applications wi l be added that wi l process some of the shipping requests based on the specific details of the transactions.  You need to recommend a replacement for the storage account queue to ensure that each additional application wi l be able to read the relevant transactions.

4、storage

You need to design a storage solution for an app that wi l store large amounts of frequently used data. The solution must meet the fo lowing requirements:  Maximize data throughput.  Prevent the modification of data for one year.  Minimize latency for read and write operations. 



Storage account type: BlockBlobStorage

Storage service: Blob



5、app

storage1 == V2 standard

storage2 == V2 Premium

storage3 == BlobStorage Standard

storage4 == FileStorage Premium

App1 == use lifecyclemanagement to migrate data between storage tiers

App2 == store app data in an Azure file share



App1: Storage1 and storage3 only

App2: Storage1 and storage4 only



6、storage

You are designing an application that wi l be hosted in Azure.  The application wi l host video files that range from 50 MB to 12 GB. The application wi l use certificate-based authentication and wi l be available to users on the internet.  You need to recommend a storage option for the video files. The solution must provide the fastest read performance and must minimize storage costs. 



Azure Blob Storage 





7、DB

You are designing a SQL database solution. The solution wi l include 20 databases that wi l be 20 GB each and have varying usage patterns.  You need to recommend a database platform to host the databases. The solution must meet the fo lowing requirements:  The solution must meet a Service Level Agreement (SLA) of 99.99% uptime.  The compute resources a located to the databases must scale dynamica ly.  The solution must have reserved capacity.  Compute charges must be minimized.

8、DB

You have an on-premises database that you plan to migrate to Azure.  You need to design the database architecture to meet the fo lowing requirements:  Support scaling up and down.  Support geo-redundant backups.  Support a database of up to 75 TB.  Be optimized for online transaction processing (OLTP).  What should you include in the design?



Service: Azure SQL Database

Service tier: Hyperscale



9、IoT

You are planning an Azure IoT Hub solution that wi l include 50,000 IoT devices.  Each device wi l stream data, including temperature, device ID, and time data. Approximately 50,000 records wi l be written every second. The data wi l be visualized in near real time.  You need to recommend a service to store and query the data. 



Azure Cosmos DB SQL API

Azure Time Series Insights





10、DB

You are designing an application that wi l aggregate content for users.  You need to recommend a database solution for the application. The solution must meet the fo lowing requirements:  Support SQL commands.  Support multi-master writes.  Guarantee low latency read operations.
